    On conversion to candidate, start election:
      ✓ increments currentTerm 
      ✓ votes for self 
      ✓ resets election timer 
      sending RequestVote RPCs to all other servers

        ✓ is converted to follower and updates term when outdated 
        ✓ is not granted a vote when target server that has already voted for another server 
        ✓ is not granted a vote when the candidate log is not up to date 
    If votes received from majority of servers, become leader
      with 5 peers in network
        ✓ becomes leader when receiving 3 votes 
        ✓ does not become leader when receiving 2 votes 
      with 4 peers in network
        ✓ becomes leader when receiving 3 votes 
        ✓ does not become leader when only receiving 2 votes 
    If AppendEntries RPC received from new leader: convert to follower
      ✓ becomes follower when receiving AppendEntries from leader 
    Receiver AppendEntries Implementation
      ✓ replies false if term < currentTerm 
      ✓ replies true if term >= currentTerm 
      ✓ reply false if log doesn't contain entry at prevLogIndex 
      ✓ reply false if log doesn't contain entry at prevLogIndex whose terms matches prevLogTerm 
      ✓ reply true if log does contain entry at prevLogIndex whose terms matches prevLogTerm 
      ✓ appends any new entries not already in the log 
      ✓ sets commitIndex=leaderCommit if leaderCommit > commitIndex and leaderCommit < index of last new entry 
      ✓ sets commitIndex=index of last new entry if leaderCommit > commitIndex and index of last new entry < leaderCommit 
      ✓ sets commitIndex=leaderCommit of last new entry if leaderCommit > commitIndex and index of last new entry == leaderCommit 
      If an existing entry conflicts with a new one
        ✓ deletes existing entry and all that follows 

  Client Log Entry Request
    ✓ client sends log request to server 
    ✓ client sends log request to a follower 

  General rules for servers
    ✓ If successful: ipdate nextIndex and matchIndex for follower. 
    ✓ If AppendEntries fails because of log inconsistency: decrement nextIndex and retry. 
    If there exists an N such that N > commitIndex .... (advance commit index)
      ✓ updates commitIndex if majority of servers matches that index 
      ✓ does not update commitIndex if majority of servers does not match that index
