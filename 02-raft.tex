\section{Raft}
\label{sec:raft}
As of writing this report, the most recent proposal to solving the consensus problem is Raft~\cite{Raft}. Diego Ongaro and John Oustershout argue that most consensus algorithms, such as Paxos~\cite{Paxos} suffer from poor understandability and are hard to understand and implement. Diego and John introduce Raft as a simple and understandable solution to the consensus problem.

\subsection{Components of Raft}
Raft is described as having three main components, where the first two describes the behaviour of algorithm and the last describes how the algorithm ensures consensus safety properties.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Leader election}: A strong leader is elected which responsible for keeping the rest of the system in consensus for a term that ends if it fails.
  \item \textbf{Log replication}: The leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other servers to agree with its own log~\cite{Raft}.
  \item \textbf{Safety}: The specified design provides safety such that\cite{Raft}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Election Safety}: There is always at most one leader in the system.
        \item \textbf{Leader Append-Only}: A leader can only append new entries to its log i.e. it cannot overwrite existing entries.
        \item \textbf{Log Matching}: The logs of all servers are matching up to their latest common index and term.
        \item \textbf{Leader Completeness}: No newly elected leaders will overwrite other server's log if its own log entry is not up to date.
        \item \textbf{State Machine Safety}: When a server updates its log it must be up to date with the leader's log.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Maybe rewrite below to fit new chapter

The above description of Raft serves as a rough overview of the algorithm. A more detailed description will be given during the implementation since the paper has implicit or unclear implementation specific components that we have to figure out ourselves. So as we every component is describes our experiences and findings in terms of implementation specific choices will thus be documented.
