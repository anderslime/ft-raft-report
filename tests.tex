\section{Acceptance tests}
\label{sec:tests}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Safety}:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is at most one leader at any given term.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user starts the program in which two servers $S_1$ and $S_2$ have the same election time out.
        \item A leader $L$, being the only one with an election time out smaller than both $S_1$ and $S_2$'s, gets elected.
        \item The user crashes $L$.
        \item Both $S_1$ and $S_2$ start their elections.
        \item Either $S_1$ or $S_2$ is elected as the new leader.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Leader never overwrites its own log but only appends on to it.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user starts the program.
        \item A server $L$ is elected as leader.
        \item The user requests that a value $x$ is replicated.
        \item The user requests that a value $y$ is replicated.%Er ikke sikker p√• at det illustrerer det korrekt.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Logs of every server match each other up to their latest common index in their logs.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user starts the program.
        \item A server $L$ is eleced as leader.
        \item The user requests that a value $x$ is replicated.
        \item The user crashes a server $S$.
        \item The user requests that a value $y$ is replicated.
        \item All the servers have a commonality that they know of $x$ but not $y$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item The log of a leader contains all previous log entries of leader of previous terms.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user starts the program with a server $L$ with the lowest election time out and $S$ with the second lowest.
        \item $L$ is elected as leader.
        \item The user crashes a server $S$.
        \item The user requests that a value $x$ is replicated.
        \item The user wakes up $S$
        \item The user crashes $L$
        \item $S$ has an up to date log.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Availability}:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item As long as a majority vote is possible, a leader must always be elected. If not the system should become unavailable.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user starts the program with five servers.
        \item A server $L$ is elected as leader.
        \item The user crashes $L$ and another server.
        \item A new leader $L'$ is elected as leader.
        \item The user crashes $L'$.
        \item The system becomes unavailable.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
